## Introduction
### In this Repository you will find the Lab Contents of my Emerging Technology Module from 4th Year Semester 1 and from knowledge of completing these labs and with the help of my lecturer Ian McLoughlin I have developed a better grasp of machine learning and quantum computing while also learning how to use juypter labs in conjunction with docker to create a simple and easy-to-understand repository. These notebooks demonstrate my work with the Python libraries pandas and numpy, which are essential to operate with the jupyter notebook's numerous algorithms.

## Setup Instructions & Use:
### • Create [Github](https://github.com/) account
### • Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
### • Download & install [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) if on Windows
### • Download & install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Jupyter Notebooks :

### In order to "create open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing spanning dozens of programming languages," Project Jupyter was founded. The main purpose of Jupyter is to make data science and scientific computing accessible to all programmers.

### This project consits of two of Jupyter's main notebooks: 
        • scikit-learn
        • quantum-deutsch
        
### scikit-learn walks through the many [algorithms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) available in scikit-learn Machine Learning in Python. Additionally, it exhibits basic data visualization and provides instances of why huge organizations employ this site's algorithms.
