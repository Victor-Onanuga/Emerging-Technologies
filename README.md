## Introduction
### In this Repository you will find the Lab Contents of my Emerging Technology Module from 4th Year Semester 1 and from knowledge of completing these labs and with the help of my lecturer Ian McLoughlin I have developed a better grasp of machine learning and quantum computing while also learning how to use juypter labs in conjunction with docker to create a simple and easy-to-understand repository. These notebooks demonstrate my work with the Python libraries pandas and numpy, which are essential to operate with the jupyter notebook's numerous algorithms.

## Setup Instructions:
### • Create [Github](https://github.com/) account
### • Download & install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
### • Download & install [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) if on Windows
### • Download & install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
### • Run the following commands in Cmder for Quantum Notebook:
       -pip3 install qiskit
       -pip install pylatexenc

## How to run the Application:
1. Using either cmder or command prompt, navigate to the repository location. For example: C:cd Users/Owner/Repo/Emerging-Technologies/Assignment.
2. To run any of the notebooks, type jupyter lab in the current directory

## Jupyter Notebooks :

### In order to "create open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing spanning dozens of programming languages," Project Jupyter was founded. The main purpose of Jupyter is to make data science and scientific computing accessible to all programmers.

### This project consits of two of Jupyter's main notebooks: 
        • scikit-learn
        • quantum-deutsch
        
## Sickit-Algothrims

### Sickit algothrims employ the datasets we import to do tasks like linear regression and correlation in a Jupyter Notebook. Sickit-learn is described in great depth in this repository.

### scikit-learn walks through the many [algorithms](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) available in scikit-learn Machine Learning in Python. Additionally, it exhibits basic data visualization and provides instances of why huge organizations employ this site's algorithms.

## Quantum-Computing

### A thorough examination of quantum computing and its classical counterpart is provided in quantum-deutsch. The [Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm), developed by Deutsch, is then covered, and a simulation of it is performed using the qiskit Open-Source Quantum Development.
