    "- To understand how matter and energy interact on an atomic and subatomic level, quantum mechanics is the most important theory. Quantum physics and quantum mechanics are terms used to describe the behavior and appearance of matter and energy at that level. What is the connection between quantum computing and quantum theory? Is it true that quantum computing is an area of computing that uses quantum theory to make computer technology work? Information can only be encoded in bits with a value of 1 or 0 using classical computering, which is the predominant form in use today. Quantum computing, on the other hand, makes use of units known as \"quantum bits\" or \"qubits.\" Using subatomic particles' unique ability to exist in multiple states at once, it achieves its goal (i.e., a 1 and a 0 at the same time)"
